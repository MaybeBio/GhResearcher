# GhResearcher 🔬

[En](README.md) | [中文](README_zh.md)

A powerful GitHub Code & Repo Analysis CLI for Researchers, designed to track activities, scrape repository contexts, and search intelligently—**without leaving YOUR terminal**.

---

## 📖 Introduction

**GhResearcher** is a terminal-based toolkit built for researchers, developers, and tech enthusiasts who need to keep a close eye on the open-source ecosystem. Instead of navigating through web interfaces, GhResearcher leverages the GitHub REST API and GitHub CLI (`gh`) to bring timelines, repository structures, and multi-domain searches directly to your command line. 

Whether you want to track a specific expert's "feed", monitor the activities of a lab/organization, or quickly dump a repository's structure into an LLM-friendly context file, GhResearcher provides the necessary utilities in a clean, terminal-native format powered by `Rich` and `Typer`.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **Curing "Free-Range" Research:** Many researchers and grad students (especially in computational fields) feel isolated without daily guidance. This tool acts as your academic "social feed" for code. By tracking what experts and labs are actively working on, it keeps you involved, gives you clear targets, and ensures you stay motivated and closely aligned with mainstream developments.
- **Terminal First:** Keep you in the flow. No context switching to a web browser.
- **Data Density:** Present maximum information with minimal clutter. Long commit hashes are truncated; pagination is handled automatically.
- **LLM-Friendly:** Commands like `scrape` are explicitly designed to generate `.md` files that can be directly fed into Language Models for code analysis and project understanding.
- **Privacy & Security:** Relies entirely on your local `gh` authentication. No third-party servers, no telemetry.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Tracking (`monitor`)**: 
  - Track events from Users, Organizations (`--org`), or specific Repositories (`--repo`).
  - Read a user's GitHub Feed (`--received`) to see what experts are paying attention to.
  - Seamless pagination handling to bypass standard API constraints.
- **Repository Scraper (`scrape`)**:
  - Automatically clone (shallow) and generate a Markdown file containing the project's README, description, and an ASCII directory tree.
- **Multi-domain Search (`search`)**:
  - Quickly search across repos, code, issues, and pull requests.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites
1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: You must have the [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) installed and authenticated.
   ```bash
   # 1. Install gh (Ubuntu/Debian example)
   # follow https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#debian
   (type -p wget >/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt install wget -y)) \
	&& sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings \
	&& out=$(mktemp) && wget -nv -O$out https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
	&& cat $out | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null \
	&& sudo chmod go+r /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
	&& sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/sources.list.d \
	&& echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
	&& sudo apt update \
	&& sudo apt install gh -y



   # 2. Authenticate with your GitHub account
   gh auth login
   ```

### Install GhResearcher
Clone the repository and install it via `pip`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaybeBio/GhResearcher.git
cd GhResearcher
pip install -e .
```
Verify the installation:
```bash
ghresearcher --help
```

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### 1. Monitoring Activities (`monitor`)

The `monitor` command provides a unified chronological timeline of GitHub activities.

Three important commands daily for me:
```python
# you can change the target file to your own file

# yesterday to today activities of my followed experts
ghresearcher monitor -f /data2/GhResearcher/tests/target_user.txt --since $(date -d "1 day ago" +%Y-%m-%d) --expand-commits

# yesterday to today activities of my followed experts (received)
ghresearcher monitor -f /data2/GhResearcher/tests/target_user.txt --since $(date -d "1 day ago" +%Y-%m-%d) -r --expand-commits

# yesterday to today activities of my followed organizations
ghresearcher monitor -f /data2/GhResearcher/tests/target_org.txt --since $(date -d "1 day ago" +%Y-%m-%d) --org --expand-commits
```

**Usage:** `ghresearcher monitor [OPTIONS] [TARGET]`

#### Monitor a Single User
Track the public actions of a specific developer (e.g., pushes, stars, forks).
```bash
# Monitor my activities (single user)
ghresearcher monitor MaybeBio -l 5

# Monitor multiple users (file input)
ghresearcher monitor -f users_to_track.txt 
# ghresearcher monitor -f ./tests/target_user.txt --since 2026-05-11 --expand-commits
```

what you get is:
```python

#### Monitor a specific Repository (`--repo`)
Focus cleanly on the event stream of a single repository (e.g., releases, issues, PRs, stars).
```bash
# Monitor a single repository (isblab/disobind)
ghresearcher monitor isblab/disobind --repo -l 20

# Monitor multiple repositories (file input)
ghresearcher monitor -f repos_to_track.txt --repo
```

what you get is
```python
Fetching events for target(s): isblab/disobind...

```

#### Monitor a User's Feed (`--received`)
Discover new tools by looking at what an expert is watching. This fetches the "received events" feed (similar to the GitHub homepage feed).
```bash
ghresearcher monitor teorth --received
```
what you get is

#### Batch Monitoring
Pass a text file with multiple targets (one per line) to merge their activities into a single global timeline.
```bash
ghresearcher monitor -f experts.txt --since 2026-05-01 --until 2026-05-12
```

#### Expanded Commits
By default, long pushes are truncated. Use `--expand-commits` to fetch detailed commit messages via additional API calls.
```bash
ghresearcher monitor teorth --expand-commits
```

what you get is
```python

### 2. Scraping Repository Context (`scrape`)

Dumps a repository's metadata, README, and directory tree into a single `Context.md` file, perfect for sharing context with ChatGPT or Claude.

**Usage:** `ghresearcher scrape [REPO]`

```bash
ghresearcher scrape isblab/disobind -o Disobind_Context.md
```
*Note: This performs a shallow clone (`git clone --depth 1`) in a temporary directory to generate the tree efficiently.*

---

### 3. Searching GitHub (`search`)

Perform tailored searches from the terminal.

**Usage:** `ghresearcher search [item_type] [query]`

```bash
# Search for repositories related to "Deep Learning"
ghresearcher search repos "Deep Learning" -L Python -l 10
```

## ⚠️ Limits & Caveats

- **GitHub API Limits:** The `monitor` timeline is restricted to a maximum of 300 recent events or events within the past 90 days due to GitHub API constraints.
- **Scraper Size:** The `scrape` command currently builds the tree in memory and clones the repository. Extremely massive repositories (10,000+ files) may take longer or consume significant memory.
- **Rate Limiting:** Heavy use of `--expand-commits` or batch mapping large lists may quickly consume your GitHub API rate limit. Use with care.
